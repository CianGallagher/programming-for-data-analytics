# Programming for Data Analytics (PFDA)

This repository showcases my work for the "Programming for Data Analytics" module. The focus of this module is on developing programming skills for handling, visualizing, and analyzing data, as well as designing algorithms for data-intensive applications.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout this module, I have gained proficiency in:

- **Data Structures**: Using appropriate data structures and techniques for efficiently handling large-scale data.
- **Numerical Libraries**: Leveraging standard numerical and scientific libraries, including NumPy and Pandas, to perform complex data manipulation and analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Programmatically creating plots and visual outputs using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Regular Expressions**: Using regular expressions for data cleaning and text manipulation.
- **Algorithm Design**: Developing and implementing algorithms to solve numerical and data-related problems.
- **Machine Learning**: Working with basic machine learning models using scikit-learn for predictive analytics.
- **Database Interaction**: Interfacing with databases, specifically working with SQLite for storing and querying data.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three main directories to reflect the different types of work completed during the course:

- **`assignments/`**: Contains practical assignments focusing on data manipulation, visualization, and algorithmic solutions.
- **`project/`**: Includes the final project, which demonstrates the culmination of the skills learned, with a focus on solving a real-world data problem.
- **`my-work/`**: Personal experiments and additional practice work related to the module.

## Key Skills Developed

- **Python Programming**: Proficient in writing clean, efficient Python code, especially in the context of data analysis.
- **Data Handling and Cleaning**: Extensive experience using Pandas for reading, transforming, and cleaning datasets.
- **Data Visualization**: Skilled at creating insightful and informative visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Machine Learning**: Implemented basic machine learning workflows, including model training, evaluation, and cross-validation using scikit-learn.
- **SQL Databases**: Practical knowledge of working with SQLite databases for storing and retrieving structured data.
- **Algorithmic Problem-Solving**: Developed algorithms to automate tasks, optimize processes, and handle large datasets efficiently.
  
## Final Project blog initial blog style notes

Working in the financial industry - I have a great interest in the financial markets and it's intersection with technology. Given this, I have decided to endevour to analyse historical financial data in this notebook. The scope is not yet finalised but I'd like to:
1. Implement some areas of interest I research such a quantative analysis.
2. Ingest the data after researching APIs and sources of said data.
3. Organise/clean the data once ingested.
4. Perform some analysis - Undecided but perhaps risk adjusted returns or a comparison of sharpe ratios etc.
5. Plot findings
6. ** Bonus ** Implement machine learning if it makes sense.

1. Data source priority - low cost(free), data relevance, ease of use for correctors.
I've used yfinance before but I believe they have recently implemented fees and the basic version is becoming ever more restricted(will have to verify this). There is a lot of chatter online about polygons API which is free, easy to use, and has been used by companies like Google, Revolut, Motley Fool, Kraken, and Stanford. Another source I've been interested in trying is Financial Modelling Prep(FMP) for similar reasons to polygon. I'll look into both and make a determination based on the projects requirements. If appropriate I will implement one of these sources to start the project. If these approaches are deemed too cumbersome for correctors I will opt for simpler sources.

YFinance appears to still be free when requesting the data required for a project like this so we'll be using Yfinance.
